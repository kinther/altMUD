1.  Why fork tbaMUD?

1.1    Ideological differences

I grew up in the early 1990's when MUDs were still one of the best multiplayer
experiences out there.  My first introduction to MUDs was when I happened to
visit a library in Seattle during my early teenage years.  Several other kids
were playing a CircleMUD known as "Realms of the Exiled".  They showed me how
to use telnet, how to access the game, and I was off to make my first PC.

After some time I grew bored of the simple hack and slash games.  I visited
the MUD Connector (which is still around to this day) and found that not all
MUDs played the same way.  There was everything from nonstop player-killing
games to roleplay intensive.  My eyes opened, and for the next 20 years I
bounced from game to game.

As I grew older I found that the MUD community began to lose its share of the
gaming marketplace.  The new generation was playing graphical games and all
of my favorite games had begun to close shop, so to speak.  I decided to pick
up coding as a hobby and try to save some of the best features of the games
I enjoyed.

There were already several MUDs with public repositories to look over, and
after pouring over several options to work with I landed on CircleMUD.  The
most recent version of CircleMUD was maintained by The Builder Academy.  While
they had kept the spirit of CircleMUD alive, I saw potential in continuing
that effort in a new direction.

The Builder Academy is far and away the best resource for learning about MUDs
in general.  Where we differ is in approach to adding new features and releasing
them to the public to use.  They have kept the traditional hack and slash MUD
alive, making a template for others to build upon, whereas I aim to add more
features, modernize the code, and keep it competitive with alternatives written
in other languages such as Python.

1.2    A novel project for a beginning coder

I am by no means a software engineer.  My specialty lies in networking and
systems administration.  This project is partially to introduce myself to
coding in C, as well as contributing to a community project that I hope in
time will be used by others.

2.1    Github repository

In 2019 most software engineers use a versioning system known as git.  I have
chosen to use Github as the repository for this fork.  As of the writing of
this FAQ file, you can find this repository at

https://github.com/kinther/altMUD.git

I am open to bug fixes, suggestions, and any feedback you might have.  Please
open an issue on the project.  If you'd like to support this endeavor, drop
