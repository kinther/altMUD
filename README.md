which change how the game is played significantly.

* Levels and experience points have been removed in favor of skill progression
* Permanent death of characters if they die
* Emoting is now preferred over standard socials

version 0.2.0 goals:

* Remove legacy features not needed - happyhour, merriam-webster
* Add new features - ranged weapons that require ammo, skinning of animals for hides/meat
* Update documentation and fix bugs as needed.
