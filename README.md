Files for altMUD.

The goal of this fork is to introduce several features to the tbaMUD codebase
which change how the game is played significantly.

* Levels and experience points have been removed in favor of skill progression
* Permanent death of characters if they die
* Emoting is now preferred over standard socials

TO-DO:

* Migrate player files to SQL database
* Create account structure with a one character per account limit
* Expand emoting system further
