Files for TestMud.

The goal of this fork is to introduce several features to the tbaMUD codebase
which allow for "Roleplay Intensive" gameplay.  These include:

* Expanded emoting system using tokens for targeting other players, items, etc.
* Levels and experience points have been removed
* Permanent death of characters if they die
* Account system for reviewing player characters before approval
* Skills are increased slowly through use
* Socials are pruned down to those that do not break RP
* Some new, some old skills found from https://www.circlemud.org/pub/CircleMUD/submissions/snippets/
