Files for tbaRPI.

License is the same as standard tbaMUD - see the
doc/license.txt file for more information.  Any additions to the codebase are
likely from open sourced snippets contributed to the MUD community over the
past 20+ years and are tagged with a "Credit to..." comment.

The goal of this fork is to introduce several features to the tbaMUD codebase
which allow for "Roleplay Intensive" gameplay.  These include:

* Expanded emoting system using tokens for targeting other players, items, etc.
* Levels and experience points have been removed
* Death is permanent
