			   THE altMUD TRIBUNE
   		 "We break things quickly and without purpose."

NEW COMMANDS AND NEW MUD BEHAVIOR:
---------------------------------
**  Skills now increase slowly through practice.  The "practice" command
has been removed from the game.

**  Stun points have been added to the game, which is a measure of your mental
well being.  Right now if you were to drop to 0 stun points, you would be
knocked out and fall asleep.  More to come.

**  Weapon skills have been added.  Practicing with different weapon types
will improve your skill with those weapons, making it easier to hit your
opponent.

** Permanent death occurs now if you drop to 0 health points.  Be careful
out there!
